## How Chuck Wagon Works

---

### Wesbite Overview

"The Chuck Wagon" utilizes a front-end library consisting of React and Redux. Users can learn all about this hometown restaurant - what they sell, what they value, and how they operate. Users can also add menu or store items to their cart, check-out, and leave reviews for the owners to see. "The Chuck Wagon" is all about representing the passionate restaurant owner in a way that honors their hard work and dedication to bringing quality food to their customers.

## The Chuck Wagon In Development

This website represents the fourth major project in our Digital Crafts coursework. "The Chuck Wagon" is intended to demonstrate a clear understanding of using React.js as a front-end framework. For demo purposes, all information is stored in redux-persist storage; however, the application can easily be converted into pulling and placing information into a database.

Here are some ways I would continue to develop "The Chuck Wagon":

- Hooking the website to a backend library for a more relevant storage solution.
- Hooking the website to a purchasing API to better simulate an online transaction.
- Creating a login function where users can maintain a profile along with an order history and a "favorites" page.
